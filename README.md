# Blog - Build with Nextjs, Tailwindcss, DaisyUI, Makrdown, Bun

I want to build my own blog page. I like to write and want to put my writings in a cohesive short form
to share with the public. I also want to test my skills in Frontend Development and try some new tools
like DaisyUI & Bun. 

I want to improve the quality of my code as well, which is why I want to update this project as regularly as I can and add new
features and maintain it.


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
